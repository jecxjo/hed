hed: a ed(itor) clone.

If you know how to use ed, or ex or vi you probably already know most of the
commands for hed. If you are new to the modal line editors then here is a
crash course.

A modal editor is an editor that has multiple modes of operation. Unlike
editors like Notepad or nano, which are always about typing text, a modal
editor allows you to generate text, as well as manipulate it.

When hed starts you enter Command Mode. This is recognizable by the starting
prompt

:

From Command Mode you can type out a command to read and write files, cut,
paste and delete lines and do regular expression "find and replace"
operations.

The other mode in hed is Insert Mode. This is when you can type out text. To
enter Insert Mode from Command Mode press "i" and Enter. To exit Insert Mode
just press . and Enter.

:i

To learn about all the commands, use the documentation command and lookup
commands.
